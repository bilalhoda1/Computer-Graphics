Style,,,,,
Code is consistently well documented.,5,There are no comments.,"There is an excess of comments, e.g. a comment per line, in at least some portions of the code.",Only some portions are well commented.,The code is not overly commented. Logical blocks of code are consistenly preceded by helpful comments.
Code has a consistent and pleasing style.,5,The code is a random jumble of characters. I hope I never have to see anything like this ever again in my life.,,Only some portions of the code exhibit good style. Some lines are longer than 80 characters. Comments have a haphazard style.,"All variables have meaningful names. There is a consistent, pleasing style regarding whitespace, naming, braces, and comments. All lines are within 80 characters."
Code consistently exhibits modularity.,5,The code contains one long init function.,,The code is occasionally divided into functions. Some functions are long.,"The code is modular - it consists of short, atomic functions. New functions are introduced and called to ensure modularity."
